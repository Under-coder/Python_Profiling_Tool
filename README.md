# Python_Profiling_Tool

What is Profiling?
Definition: Measuring program performance and resource usage.
Focus on identifying slow code segments.
Helps in optimizing without guessing.

The project builds a profiling tool, CodeOptimizeX, that checks the code for bottlenecks by tracking the execution time of functions. The project utilizes cProfile python library to run the profiler, and snakeviz to viualize the results.

This project is part of Hackveda Solutions Internship.
